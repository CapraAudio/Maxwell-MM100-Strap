# Printing Instructions

### This **MUST** be printed in 95a TPU! No other material is known to work!

Select the center section and change the per model settings to the ones below.<p>The thicker your infill line width + the denser your mesh and the stiffer the band will be. I dont recommend going any thinner than .4mm at 25%</br>
